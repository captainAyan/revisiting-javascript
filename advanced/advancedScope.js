/**
 * Javascript Execution Context:
 *
 * When we try to execute a JS code, there are two phases.
 * 1. Creation phase:
 *    In creation phase 3 things happens:
 *    1. It creates a global/window object.
 *    2. Sets up memory heap and stores variables and functions
 *    3. Initializes the variables with undefined and stores the function
 *       declarations.
 *
 * 2. Execution phase
 *    In the execution phase, the javascript engine executes the ode line by line.
 *    It assigns the value to variables, and executes the function calls. For every
 *    new function created, javascript creates a new execution context.
 *

/**
 * The following code should return an error like "variable not defined", as the

/// Questions (RoadsideCoder)
// Question 1: What would be the output of the following program.

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  setTimeout(function () {
    console.log(i);
  }, i * 1000);
}
/**
 * Output:
 * 0
 * 1
 * 2
 * 3
 * 4
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * A separate block scope is created for each iteration of the loop, and since
 * LET has block scope, the first iteration will have the the variable 'i' with
 * the value 0, and the following iteration will have 1, 2, 3, and 4.
 *
 * The setTimeout function is a asynchronous function, therefore it doesn't
 * pause the execution of other functions. The first delay value is 0 (0 * 1000),
 * and following are 1000, 2000, 3000, and 4000. As these timers are running
 * asynchronously, the console logging will occur with 1000 second delay, with
 * the first value being printed immediately.
 *
 * Time Graph: [ -- is one second, * is the point of console log]
 *
 * VALUE | DELAY | GRAPH
 * 0     | 0     | *
 * 1     | 1000  | --*
 * 2     | 2000  | -----*
 * 3     | 3000  | --------*
 * 4     | 4000  | -----------*

/// Function Hoisting

/**
 * Explanation:
 *
 * Hoisting works a little differently when it comes to functions. In case of
 * variables, they are hoisted with undefined as their value. But for functions,
 * a function is hoisted completely (with it's body), and therefore can be
 * accessed before it is defined.
 */

// Question 2: What would be the output of the following code?

var x = 21;

var fun2 = function () {
  console.log(x);
  var x = 20;
};

fun2(); // Output: undefined
/**
 * Explanation:
 *
 * The variable x is in the global scope, therefore is accessible inside the fun2
 * function. But since x was declared again in the function, the global variable
 * got shadowed by the local one.
 *
 * On invoking the fun2 function the javascript engine creates a new execution
 * context for that function only. During the creation phase of the execution
 * context, the javascript engine hoists the variable x with undefined. Value of
 * x will be assigned in the execution phase.
 *
 * On starting of the execution phase(of the fun2 function's execution context),
 * the engine looks for value of x in the local scope, and finds it there (so it
 * doesn't look for x in the parent scope, i.e. the Global Scope). Javascript
 * prints undefined, as that is the valued assigned to x when hoisted.
