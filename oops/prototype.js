 * Let's add methods to the __proto__ object, but first what it a prototype?
 *
 * Prototype:
 * Prototype of a class stores it's methods, that can be used by it's instances.
 * The userOne and userTwo, needs their own properties, but the methods doesn't
 * need to be hardcoded into each instance individually, they can be stored in a
 * way so that they can be share but every instance. This can be optimized by
 * using Prototype.
 *
 * If we add the method to the prototype of User, the method will be accessible
 * to all the instances of User, and won't be replicated each time a object has
 * been instantiated.
 *
 * Let's write a new constructor function that uses prototypes.
